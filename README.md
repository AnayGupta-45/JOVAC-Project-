# JOVAC-Project-
This is my first full-Stack Project. I have completed this with the help of my team members.
<br>
First we have created a landing page for our website where the user can click on filter button and start filtering colleges according to his/her choice.
<br>
Secondly, we have created the filter section page where the user can innput its filters and choose the college accordingly.
<br>
In the Third step we are going to create the filter results section page which will the list of colleges that came as a results to user's search.
